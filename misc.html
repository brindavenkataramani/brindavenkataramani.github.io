<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<p>Sorry for the bad formatting on this page. It is more for me to keep track of things I am currently working on/interested in working on. If for whatever strange reason you care to know what I'm working on - well, hopefully this is satisfactory, though I doubt it will be. Also, for anyone who cares, <a href="summary.pdf">here</a> is my research summary. It was last updated sometime in October 2020. Here is some more light-hearted <a href="fun.html">fun</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a list of problems I am actively working on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is PP equivalent to AC over ZF? This question is explored <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03664">here</a> and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ndjfl/1093635502">here</a>. There is also a discussion on <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/373700/is-the-theory-flow-actually-consistent/373722#373722"> MathOverflow</a> regarding the first of these links.</li>  
<li>Can an isomorphism of subgroups of a finite group always be extended to an automorphism?</li>
<li>What are the analytic properties of random sequences in \(\{0,1\}^{\omega}\)?</li>
</ol>
