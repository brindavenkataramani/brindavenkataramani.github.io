<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<p>Sorry for the bad formatting on this page. It is more for me to keep track of things I am currently working on/interested in working on. If for whatever strange reason you care to know what I'm working on - well, hopefully this is satisfactory, though I doubt it will be. Also, for anyone who cares, <a href="summary.pdf">here</a> is my research summary. It was last updated sometime in May 2020. Here is some more light-hearted <a href="fun.html">fun</a>.</p>

 <p>Here is a list of problems I am actively working on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is PP equivalent to AC over ZF? This question is explored here and here.<\li>  
<li>Can an isomorphism of subgroups of a finite group always be extended to an automorphism?</li>
<li>What are the analytic properties of random sequences in \(\{0,1\}^{\omega}\)? For a primer see here and the links therein.</li>
</ol>
