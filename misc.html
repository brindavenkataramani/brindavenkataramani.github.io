<p>Sorry for bad formatting on this page. It is more for me to keep track of things I am currently working on/interested in working on. If for whatever strange reason you care to know what I'm working on - well, hopefully this is satisfactory, though I doubt it will be.</p>

<h1>Symbolic computation</h1>
<p>I am trying to work out how symbolic computation works. In particular, I want to understand how infinite cyclic groups are being represented in SAGE. Of interest, because I am trying to use category theory to map <b>Set</b> into another caregory which is computationally representable while preserving some important structure. This may well turn out to be impossible, and if so this project will become defunct. Preliminary code is found <a href="https://repl.it/@quanticbolt/Parsing-Math-and-Symbolic-Computation">here</a>, but you might need to modify some things to get it to work due to versional differences. I will eventually migrate this to Git.</p>
