      <p>
         I like writing about mathematics. I'm too lazy to make an actual blog, so I'll just use my webspace to host this makeshift "blog" instead. It is minimalistic. Use CTRL+F to find whatever you're looking for. I will try to tag some keywords to search by. Posts will be seperated by horizontal rules.

      <h2>On real numbers and why we need them</h2>
      <p>
         Real numbers are ubiquitous and important. Most measurements are real numbers. Rather unsurprisingly physicists, biologists, chemists, and the like care about the real numbers. Rudin provides a reason why mathematicians should also care.
