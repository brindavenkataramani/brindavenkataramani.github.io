         I like writing about mathematics. I'm too lazy to make an actual blog, so I'll just use my webspace to host this makeshift "blog" instead. It is minimalistic. Use CTRL+F to find whatever you're looking for. I will try to tag some keywords to search by. Posts will be seperated by horizontal rules.

      <h2>On real numbers and why we need them</h2>
      <p>
         Real numbers are important. The number \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational. Here is a proof.
         
         Suppose \(\sqrt{2}\) was rational. Then we could write it in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\), and \(n\) are integers with no common divisors. But this would mean that \(2n^2=m^2\) such that \(m^2\) would be even such that \(m\) would be even (note: \((2k+1)\) is odd). But this would mean \(n^2=4k^2\), implying evenness of \(n\) contradicting the assumption that the initial fraction is in its most reduced form. The desired result that \(\sqrt{2}\) cannot be rational follows naturally.
         
         Now, we consider the following
