    <h1>Brinda Venkataramani</h1>
    <p>I am a student of physics and mathematics at McMaster University. On this page I will compile some bits and pieces of mathematics and physics which I find interesting. I shall try to be concise in my explanations of phenomena. Equations on this page are typeset in LaTeX.</p>
    <h2>Potential energy of spring</h2>
    <p>An ideal spring exerts force, \(F=-kx\) on a point-like masss. To move a mass, $m$ from equilibrium to a point $x$, we exert a constant force, $F=kx$. Potential energy of an ideal spring is hence given by, $$\int_0^xkx\,dx=\frac{1}{2}kx^2.$$</p>
