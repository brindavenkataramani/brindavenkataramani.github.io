    <h1>Brinda Venkataramani</h1>
    <p>I am a student of physics and mathematics at McMaster University. On this page I will compile some bits and pieces of mathematics and physics which I find interesting. I shall try to be concise in my explanations of phenomena. Equations on this page are typeset in LaTeX.</p>
    <h1>Contents</h1>
    <p>I will keep an index of all items on this page here. I will add hyperlinks at a later date, when time permits. Until then, you may use CTRL+F to search for a particular item.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Potential energy of a spring</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Potential energy of spring</h2>
    <p>An ideal spring exerts force, \(F=-kx\) on a mass. To move a mass, \(m\) from equilibrium to a point \(x\), we exert a constant force, \(F=kx\). Potential energy of an ideal spring is hence given by, $$\int_0^xkx\,dx=\frac{1}{2}kx^2.$$</p>
